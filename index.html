        <blockquote>"The world isn't getting any easier. With all these new inventions I believe that people are hurried
            more and pushed more... The hurried way is not the right way; you need time for everything - time to work,
            time to play, time to rest." <cite> -- Hedy Lamarr</cite></blockquote>
